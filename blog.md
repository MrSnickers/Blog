Talking about blocks pretty quickly turned into talking about the ".each" method as that has been a particular stumbling block for some of the students.  Or at least I know this one.  A well formed use of ".each" looks like:

object.each do |element|
_block of code that does something with "element"_
end

The whole conversation about what "element" is and why it doesn't need to be declared like other variables ended up taking us on a tour of how all the parts work behind the scenes.

Today was a plain text kind of day.  It just seemed to turn out that way.  Along with the general workshop on Git I also learned such fantastic things as how to scoot around in the terminal while keeping my mouse in my bag.  Splat+Tab is a good friend and is by far the best way to switch between Sublime and the terminal while I try check my work on the Ruby Assesment.

Spent most of the day working on Ruby.  Besides being the general topic of the week, it's what I worked on the most prior to acceptance, so I feel less behind.
The whole loops thing and control flow let me feel smart.  Blocks, procs, and lambdas do not.
I would be interested in seeing some in the wild.

Spent most of the day working on Ruby.  Besides being the general topic of the week, it's what I worked on the most prior to acceptance, so I feel less behind.
The whole loops thing and control flow let me feel smart.  Blocks, procs, and lambdas do not.
I would be interested in seeing some in the wild.
